- [x] Become familiar with Mujoco:
    - [x] Understand how the environment is set and how to change the robot and ball spawn positions ->
    - [x] Understand how to set reward and how to set success/termination state
    - [x] Understand how to detect falls and terminate
    - [x] Find out if we can remove the goalies and change their speed (to make them slower/faster/static)
    - [x] Determine how we can differentiate between goals in AWAY and HOME teams
    - [x] Understand how to manipulate info and observation data
- [ ] Implement the training code:
